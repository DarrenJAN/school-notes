## Readings

###[What should a Software Engineering Course look like?](http://tomasp.net/blog/2019/software-engineering/)

- SE has become a course trying to cover whatever methods and tools the industry needs; not practical (keep changing)
- what about SE will still be relevant in 100 years?
- what are the mortifications that led to ideas like waterfall and agile? (agile = need for more rapid response)
- what was the context in which UML appeared? Metaphor or an architect who designs a master rplan for a system
- believes that universities should teach historically situated software engineering as it provides a framework for critical thinking about software engineering, and past examples to guide this thinking
