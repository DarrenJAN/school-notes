- What is AI?
    - reasoning vs behaviour
    - fidelity to humans vs rationality
- We are interested in intelligent systems where ==a system is intelligent if and only if it acts rationally==
- Rational Agent Paradigm
    - agent: a function that maps from perceptions/information/input to actions
    - want them do be doing the right thing
    - performance measures: dependeont on context; goal achievement, resource consumption, etc
    - requires a task environment
- Task Environment
    - performance measures
    - environment
    - actuators: what actions are available
    - sensors: what information does it receive from the environment
- Properties of the Task Environment
    - Fully Observable vs Partially Observable
        - do sensors give agent access to complete state of environment?
    - Deterministic vs Stochastic
        - is next state completely determined by current state and action executed? or is there randomness?
    - Episodic vs Dynamic
    - Discrete vs Continuous
    - Static vs Dynamic
    - Single Agent vs MultiAgent
