- State space model: xdot = f(x,u); y = h(x,u); f = Ax + Bu; y = Cx + Du
- Linearization:
  - Equilibrium config 
  - jacobians
- Systematic method for block diagram manipulation reduction
- Cramer's rule
- 1st order eqn; Ts == 4T; bw = 1/tau
- 2nd order eqn:
  - Zeta and theta
  - Overshoot; zMin
  - Settling time; Re decreases implies Ts decreases
  - Time to peak; as Im increases then Tp decreases
  - Bw = 1/wn; -3dB lower than low frequency gain
  - $yss / b = G(0)$ For step input of $b * 1(t)$
- Matrix exponential (midterm sheet)
- State-space to transfer function (midterm sheet)
- Chapter 3:
  - every pole of G(s) has negative real part and G(s) proper <==> BIBO stable
  - Poles of G(s) contained in eigenvalues of A
  - Asymptotic is just xdot = Ax; eigenvalues of A must all have negative roots
    - Convergence
  - Asymptotic stability => BIBO stability
  - FVT
  - Bode Plots
    - Cases 1,2,3,4
- Chapter 4:
- Chapter 5:
  - Xcl, Acl
  - Internal stability defn
  - Internal stability is the same as IO stability for the purpose of this course
    - Asymptotic: eigenvalues of A ==> BIBA
    - IO: make sure all 6 TFs are stable (same as internal) ==> BIBO
    - Internal: eigenvalues of Acl (same as IO) ==> BIBO
    - BIBO: all poles < 0 of transfer functions; or impulse response in time domain is absolutely integrable
  - IO stability: all transfer functions (r,d) to (e,u,y) (page 121)
  - 5.2.3 io stability criteria
  - 5.2.5 Char poly; if char poly is H then this implies IO stability
    - All 6 TFs have the char poly on the bottom
  - Unstable plant controller pole-zero cancellation ==> unstable
  - Hurwitz defn and implication / meaning; 
    - all coefficients must be same sign
  - Routh's algorithm and what it means
    - Rule 10 has to do with imaginary crossings
  - 5.4 and on
    - IMP
      - For disturbance reference tracking you can **only** include the bad part of the disturbance in the controller
      - For tracking it can be in either
    - Input vs output disturbance
    - Pick C, then pick C1. Make it to be the simplest
- Chapter 6
  - Departure arrival angle formulas
  - Centroid formula; asymptote formula
  - N and m
  - Improper case
  - Special case of multiple poles on same spot; arrival departure angles
  - Negative gain case: no yes no from LEFT to RIGHT
    - Departure angles equal 0 instead of Pi
  - PD formula, PI formula, PID formula
  - PID pole placement
  - Made approximation
